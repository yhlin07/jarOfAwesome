**How to use this file:**
1. Add new milestones as you achieve them (don't wait!)
2. Be specific - "Increased engagement by 45%" beats "Made product better"
3. Include both big wins and small victories
4. Organize by category for easier scanning
5. Update regularly - fresh wins have more impact

**Why this works:**
- Your brain will forget these without a system
- Seeing progress in writing fights imposter syndrome
- Specific numbers make achievements real
- Random selection keeps reminders fresh and surprising
